# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

* Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
* Return k.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Constraints**:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
* -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
* nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

# Solution (Javascript)
* In this problem, the key point to focus on is the input array being sorted. As far as duplicate elements are concerned, what is their positioning in the array when the given array is sorted? If we know the position of one of the elements, do we also know the positioning of all the duplicate elements?

* We need to modify the array in-place and the size of the final array would potentially be smaller than the size of the input array. So, we ought to use a two-pointer approach here. One, that would keep track of the current element in the original array and another one for just the unique elements.

* Essentially, once an element is encountered, you simply need to bypass its duplicates and move on to the next unique element.
```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {
    let insertIndex = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // We skip to next index if we see a duplicate element
        if (nums[i - 1] != nums[i]) {
            /* Storing the unique element at insertIndex index and incrementing
               the insertIndex by 1 */
            nums[insertIndex] = nums[i];
            insertIndex++;
        }
    }
    return insertIndex;
};
```
Complexity Analysis
Let N be the size of the input array.

* Time Complexity: O(N), since we only have 2 pointers, and both the pointers will traverse the array at most once.

* Space Complexity: O(1), since we are not using any extra space.
